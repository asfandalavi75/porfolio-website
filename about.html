            <p id="aboutText"> My name is Asfand Salam Alavi and I am a CS major at <span id="highlight">SUNY New
                    Paltz</span>. I am deeply passionate about Computer Sciene, and web application development in
                particular. I have worked with many different framework including <span id="highlight">Vue.JS, React
                    and Flutter</span>. I have worked extensively on both the front-end and the backend, using <span
                    id="highlight">Express.js, Node and PHP</span> for backend coding. Out of the previously
                mentioned framework I have the most experience with <span id="highlight">Flutter</span>. Flutter is a
                very powerful and intuitive framework developed by Google which allows you to develop beautiful
                applications for Android, Apple and the web using the same codebase. It provides the developer with many
                different tools for creating modern UI elements, and increasing performance. I am most passionate about
                backend coding as it involves logical thinging and maticulous eye for the details. When it comes to
                backeknd I have the most experience using <span id="highlight">Express.JS</span>. During my
                internship at Bridger Aerospace, I worked extensively with their API, making and optimizing the endpoint
                functions, as well as designing my own for features that I worked on. This involved working iterativly
                with upper management, using their feedback to make any changes or improvements. Backend Programming
                allowed me to express my problem solving skills, as well as taught me how to look at an application as a
                unified machine. Looking at an application in such a manner allows us to understand the importance of
                every single feature. If one feature isn't properly optimized, the domino effect that can result from it
                can cause other features to suffer. Although it can be a bit challenging, the thrill of everything
                functioning properly is unmatched.
